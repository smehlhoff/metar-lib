# metar-lib

Parses latest METARs from NOAA Aviation Weather Center IAW [FCM-H1-2019](https://www.icams-portal.gov/resources/ofcm/fmh/FMH1/fmh1_2019.pdf).

See [U.S. code groups](http://www.moratech.com/aviation/metar-class/metar-pg3.html#US) for more details.

Do not use this library for real-world navigation.

## Usage

```rust
use metar_lib::*;

fn main() {
    let metar = Metar::parse("KSFO").unwrap();

    println!("The temperature at {} is {} Celsius.", metar.data.station, metar.data.temp);
}
```

## Limitations

This library parses U.S. METARs only (e.g., KSFO, KJFK).

Please open an issue if you find a METAR string that doesn't work.
